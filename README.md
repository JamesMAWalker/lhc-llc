## Lighthouse Communications

This was a site built for a telecommunications company in central Texas. They didn't need much more than an online presence, so I built them a basic brochure site that could accept customer inquiries. I took the opportunity provided by the simple job to use Svelte, a framework I had experimented with previously and very much enjoyed.
